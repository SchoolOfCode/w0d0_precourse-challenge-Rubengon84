          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>David González López «Zaafra», was born in Elvira street in 1948. He was a versatile artist since he covered many fields such as drawing , painting , sculpture and engraving ; always with an extraordinary desire for experimentation, away from all academicism. In his youth he studied Technical Architecture by paternal imposition. After finishing his degree, he moved to Gerona (1977), where he carried out restoration projects for old buildings such as the plans for the Synagogue of the old Gerona neighborhood with the Star of Davidwhich would eventually become a symbol of Girona's Jewish quarter. Here he began his professional artistic foray convinced by established painters such as Xargay, Monsó, Vaireda, Crozet and even Dalí.
          Turned professional, Zaafra moved to Switzerland , where he consolidated his style. He had gone through hyperrealism , impressionism , expressionism , abstract and material art . In Switzerland he embraced a figurative but eclectic style, with other influences. In 1983 he returned to Granada and took his brushes first to Calle Elvira where he established his workshop and exhibition point for different cultural activities in Granada. Later he established his studio definitively in Huétor Vega .</p>
