### General Info

This is my first code practice for this new amazing adventure in School of Code. I have chosen to make a tribute page to my uncle David Gonzalez "Zaafra", he was an inspiration for me
and one of the reasons why I am on this changing career path, he taught me and shows me that I need to be courageous and follow my passions and never give up for any reason. So when I read
that I need to do a tribute page, and recently it has been 3 years since his death, I think it was the perfect opportunity to bring him back to my memory and used him as a subject for this Tribute page.

### Code Languages

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

### Features

* Full responsive Website.
* JavaScript function changing and including diferents paintings everytime is loading the page.
* Animation evey time the paintings are hover.

### Future Improvements

This is a basic website with a lot of room for new features and improvements, some of them will be:

  - Reduce the divs container for the paintings making Javascript creatings those Divs.
  - Make a gallery Shows for the paintings when you pressed on them, instead of opening in a new tab.
  - Make differents visual effects and try to make it more appealing and interactive for users.
